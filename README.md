# LLM_Code_Summarization_Assessment_data

A script that includes the raw data used for evaluation, as well as the output of the model based on the data and the evaluation results of the reference text. The evaluation script input must include at least two fields: reference text and generated text

Due to the uncertainty of the output of large language models, even if parameters such as temperature are set to 0, the output results may vary slightly each time. The output results are for reference only.
